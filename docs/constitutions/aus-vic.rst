Objective
---------

The primary objective of Flux Victoria is to promote the election of

Assembly. Promotion and endorsement of candidates will be contextually
appropriate.

Further objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. To support the ends and goals of the federal party “VOTEFLUX.ORG \|
   Upgrade Democracy!” (“Flux AUS”);
2. To provide every Victorian voter with real democratic potential;
3. To use elected parliamentarians as a gateway for members to directly
   influence parliament within Victorian law, using an internal voting
   system;
4. To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents
   to participate productively without winning a seat;
5. To facilitate a culture of criticism through empowering specialists
   and passionate voters; and
6. To stimulate the creation of new policy options.

Effect as Law
-------------

The purposes of this document is to meet the requirements of
registration under the Electoral Act 2002 (Vic), and to provide guidance
to new and prospective members of the Party as to the operation of the
Party. Except to the extent required by law, nothing in this document is
intended to be binding on any person.

Membership Criteria
-------------------

Flux Victoria’s membership criteria are:

-  Maintain a list of at least 500 members who are on the Australian
   electoral roll, and whose address registered for this purpose is
   within Victoria.

Membership
----------

All Victorian residents who are eligible voters are eligible for
membership with the Party. There is no cost for membership. Each member
is required to provide their name and address such that it matches those
on the electoral roll. Members must also provide methods of contact,
including an email address. Flux Victoria also requires that the members
request membership with Flux AUS (though there is no requirement to
maintain this membership). A phone number is optional.

Membership applications are to be submitted through the Flux AUS
website, at https://voteflux.org. Members may resign or revoke their
membership through the resignation feature on the member’s membership
details page.

After at least one parliamentarian has been elected to either Flux AUS
or Flux Victoria, an additional requirement to maintain membership will
come into force. Once per year members will need to confirm their
details are up to date. They will be prompted to do so through an email
notification.

There are no obligations outside of maintaining membership.

Parliamentarians who are members of Flux Victoria are not permitted to
be members of other political parties except for Flux AUS. In a case
where a parliamentarian does find themselves a member of another party,
they must immediately resign from that other party.

Members may be expelled from the Party only in the case it is agreed
upon unanimously by the Leadership.

Structure of Flux Victoria
--------------------------

The Leadership
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a group called the Leadership. It is not required that members
of the Leadership are members of Flux Victoria.

The Leadership consists of two roles: The Leader and the Deputy Leader.
The Leader and Deputy Leader of Flux Victoria are identical to the
Leader and Deputy Leader (respectively) of Flux AUS at all times. What
constitutes a decision of the Leadership is defined by the Flux AUS
constitution, as may be updated from time to time.

Pursuant to the rules for decision making (under “Administration”) the
Leadership have the ultimate decision making power for Flux Victoria.

However, the Leadership do not have general responsibility for any
aspect of Flux Victoria, and it is the intention of the Party that the
Leadership will only exercise that power as necessary to protect the
interests of Flux Victoria and Flux AUS.

Office Bearers (“Official Roles”)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a group called the Office Bearers. Only members can be Office
Bearers. Each Office Bearer has an Official Role. The Office Bearers
have responsibility for the day to day operation of Flux Victoria, in a
manner consistent with their Official Role description:

direction of Flux Victoria. To be eligible for appointment to the
Steering Committee, a person must be an Office Bearer or be part of the
Leadership.

When this constitution comes into effect, the Steering Committee will
come into existence comprised of all Office Bearers and the Leadership.

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decision Making
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decisions will comprise of two types:

-  Routine; and
-  Tactical.

Routine decisions are those that need to be made on a regular basis, are
of minor consequence, and are consistent with the vision of Flux
Victoria. Examples of routine decisions include: \* “Reposting” a story
on social media; \* Calling a party meeting; \* Confirming minor details
or clarifications with the Victorian Electoral Commission; \* Appling
small amounts of petty cash for advertising material; and \* Responding
to membership enquiries.

Routine decisions can be made by any Office Bearer who reasonably
believes it is in the interests of Flux Victoria to do so, and when it
is within the scope of their Official Role or delegated authority to
make that decision.

Tactical decisions are those that alter the direction of the Party,
alter the distribution of power within the Party, or are likely to have
serious consequences for the Party. Examples of tactical decisions
include:

-  Appointing members to Official Roles or the Steering Committee;
-  Creating alliances (formal or informal) with other political parties;
-  Calling an AGM;
-  Endorsement of candidates;
-  The expenditure of large sums of money; and
-  Determining whether a decision to be made or previously made should
   be regarded as routine or tactical.

Tactical decision can me made in two ways:

-  At a party meeting, a decision may be made by agreement of more than
   50% of all Steering Committee members in attendance; or
-  Decisions may be made by the Leadership. This decision making power
   may be delegated in whole or part to Office Bearers. Nothing in this
   delegation removes the power from the Leadership, and the delegation
   may be removed at any time. The Secretary (or all available members
   of SteerCo) must be notified at the earliest possible convenience of
   the Leadership, and the decision is not effective until this
   notification is made. The Secretary must notify all present members
   at the next party meeting.

A decision of the Steering Committee prevails only to the extent it is
consistent with all decisions of the Leadership.

Annual General Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Party is required to hold Annual General Meetings (AGMs) once per
calendar year.

An AGM is to be chaired by the Secretary and follow an agenda. Members
will be notified by email at least 1 week before the AGM of the agenda,
and may suggest amendments to the agenda.

All Office Bearers and the Leadership are required to be present, but
the non-attendance by any person will not render the AGM invalid.
Members may request to be invited to the AGM. Only members who are so
invited may participate. Participants at the AGM do not have to be
present in one physical location, so long as they are able to
participate effectively (normally using technological solutions).

The meeting will be livestreamed such that it is available to all
members, whether or not they are participating in the AGM.

Party Meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Party meetings may be called. A reasonable attempt must be made to
notify and invite the Steering Committee to the meeting, and provide
them with sufficient details to attend the meeting. Any A quorum of the
Steering Committee may be set; if so the party meeting may only proceed
if the quorum attend. It is not required that members generally are
notified.

Handling of Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handling of assets is the responsibility of the Treasurer. At the
discretion of the Treasurer, other Office Bearers may handle assets. The
Leadership may also handle assets, but must inform the Treasurer, and
must do so as soon as reasonably practical.

Keeping of the Party’s accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Treasurer is responsible for managing the Party’s finances. Funds
should be used only for the purposes of furthering the objectives of the
Party; however, there is no other restriction on what funds may be spent
on (except as prohibited by relevant law).

The Registered Officer is responsible for collating and submitting
required documents to the VEC, and for keeping relevant party records as
required by law.

Amendments to this Constitution
-------------------------------

Amendments to this constitution can be made only by a decision at a
party meeting with a quorum at least 80% of the Steering Committee. The
decision to alter must be passed unanimously.

The Leadership have the power to alter the Constitution unilaterally.

Endorsed Candidates
-------------------

Endorsed candidates are chosen by the Leadership or at a party meeting
with a quorum of at least 80% of the Steering Committee. The decision to
endorse must be passed with a 66% majority.

The Leadership hold veto power over any candidate chosen.

Internal Voting System
----------------------

Flux Victoria is committed to implementing an internal voting system to
facilitate members participating in the parliamentary process, and in
the decision making of the Party.

It is a requirement that this issue be raised at every AGM until such a
time as it is implemented.

The parameters and design choices of the system are left to the
Leadership, and not within the scope of this document.
