Introduction
------------

This is the constitution for the WA political party named “The Flux
Party — WA”, sometimes referred to as “Flux WA” or “The Party” in this
document. The registered abbreviation for the party at the time of
registration is “Flux The System!”. It is a state party associated with
the federal party “VOTEFLUX.ORG \| Upgrade Democracy!” with the
abbreviation “Flux”. The term “Flux AUS” is used to refer to the federal
Flux Party, not the state party.

The Flux Party — WA is hereby established as an organisation.

The canonical version of the constitution is stored in the repository at
https://github.com/voteflux/flux/ under the file name
``CONSTITUTION.WA.md``.

Clauses should be referred to by line number and most recent commit
hash.

Flux WA intends to defer many of the responsibilities for running the
party to the federal Flux party, and this is indicated in this document.

This document is ratified when the federal Flux constitution is updated
to reflect this fact. This will be recorded under the section titled
“State and Territory Branches”. At the time of writing this link will
take an observer to said ratification:

Objective
---------

The primary objective of Flux WA is to promote the election of endorsed
candidates to the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of
Western Australia. Promotion and endorsement of candidates will be
contextually appropriate.

Further objectives:

-  To provide every WA voter with real democratic potential
-  To use elected candidates as a gateway for electors to directly
   influence the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council within
   Australian law, using an internal voting system
-  To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents
   to participate productively without winning a seat
-  To facilitate a culture of criticism through empowering specialists
   and passionate voters
-  To stimulate the creation of new policy options

Flux WA also adopts objectives of the federal Flux party where possible.

Membership Criteria
-------------------

Flux WA’s membership criterion is:

-  Maintain a list of at least 500 members who are electors within the
   WA

Membership
~~~~~~~~~~

All WA electors are eligible for membership. They may join by joining
the federal Flux party, and all relevant members joining are admitted
automatically. Members of the federal Flux party may opt out of
inclusion in the state party via their membership details page. There is
no cost for membership. Each member is required to provide their name
and address such that it matches the electoral roll. Other required
details include methods of contact, an email address is required, a
phone number is optional. Their membership application is to be
submitted through Flux AUS’s website, at https://voteflux.org. Members
may resign or revoke their membership through the resignation feature on
the member’s membership details page. There is only one category of
membership, and members are always referred to as ‘members’.

Members retain membership by retaining membership to the federal Flux
party.

There are no obligations outside of maintaining membership.

Elected candidates who are members of Flux WA are not permitted to be
members of other WA political parties, though regular members may be
members of other parties. In a case where an elected candidate does find
themselves a member of another party, they must immediately resign from
that other party.

Members may be expelled from the party only in the case it is agreed
upon unanimously by the Leadership. Members may be suspended from the
party only in the case it is agreed upon unanimously by the Leadership.

Decision Making
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

purposes of decision making a quorum is achieved in any instance where:

-  The Leader is present
-  The Deputy Leader and one other member of the Leadership is present
-  All members of The Steering Committee are present

The Leader may imbue any member with special authority for specific

veto decisions made by any quorum in which they are not present.

Annual General Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The party is required to announce an Annual General Meetings (AGMs) once
per calendar year at a time of the Leadership’s choosing. The AGM must
occur within one month of the annoucement. These AGMs may be chaired by
the secretary of the federal Flux Party or the secretary of Flux WA.

This rules around AGMs (except those above) are identical in an ongoing
basis to the section titled “Annual General Meeting” in the federal Flux
constitution.

At the time of writing this was:

    An AGM is to be chaired by the secretary and follow an agenda. The
    agenda is open for any member to add an item. Members will be
    notified by email at least 1 week before the AGM. The Leadership is
    required to be present where possible, and the meeting will be
    livestreamed to members. Members may request to be invited to the
    AGM. Only members who are invited by the Leadership may participate.
    The AGM does not have to occur in one physical place; an online AGM
    is okay.

Party Meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Party meetings may be called by the Leadership as per the section on
decision making. A quorum is required. Members are not required to be
notified. Party meetings are not *required* to be held, ever.

Handling of Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handling of assets is the responsibility of the Leadership and they must
always act within the interests of the party. At their discretion other
party members may handle assets. The Leader and Deputy Leader are
entitled to handle assets.

quorum can authorize spending of funds. Funds should be used only for
the purposes of furthering the objectives of the party, and there is no
other restriction on what funds may be spent on (except anything
prohibited under Australian Law). The Leadership and registered officer,
together, are responsible for collating and submitting required
documents to the WAEC, and for keeping relevant party records for the
times required by law.

Amendments to this Constitution
-------------------------------

Amendments to this constitution can be made with the support of at least
66% of a quorum, or at the discretion of the Party Leader. They are to
be submitted via pull request to the relevant Github repository.

Endorsed Candidates
-------------------

Endorsed candidates are chosen by The Leader or by 100% agreement of The
Flux WA Steering Committee, though any candidates chosen by The Steering
Committee are able to be vetoed by the Leader.

Internal Voting System
----------------------

Flux WA will use an internal voting system to

-  Facilitate all WA electors participating in the democratic process
   once a Flux WA candidate is elected
-  Facilitate members participating in the democratic process
-  Facilitate minor parties and independents’ productive participation
   without winning a seat

The parameters and design choices of the system are left to the Leader,
and not within the scope of this document. There is no requirement that
the voting system for members is the same as the voting system for minor
parties. This voting system may be provided by the federal Flux party’s
voting system, though in this case participation for WA specific issues
is restricted to WA electors.
