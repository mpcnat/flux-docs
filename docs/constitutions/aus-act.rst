Introduction
------------

This is the constitution for the ACT political party named “The Flux
Party — ACT”, sometimes referred to as “Flux ACT” or “the party” in this
document only. The registered abbreviation for the party at the time of
registration is “The Flux Party (Flux The System)”. It is a branch of
the federal party “VOTEFLUX.ORG \| Upgrade Democracy!” with the
abbreviation “Flux”. When the term “Flux” alone is used it is meant to
refer to the federal Flux party, not the state branch.

The Flux Party — ACT is hereby established as an organization.

The canonical version of the constitution is stored in the repository at
https://github.com/voteflux/flux/ under the file name
``CONSTITUTION.ACT.md``.

Clauses should be referred to by line number and most recent commit
hash.

Flux ACT intends to defer many of the responsibilities for running the
party to the federal Flux party, and this is indicated in this document.

This document is ratified when the federal Flux constitution is updated
to reflect this fact and must include an appropriate commit hash of this
document. This will be recorded under the section titled “State and
Territory Branches”. At the time of writing this like will take an
observer to said ratification:

Objective
---------

The primary objective of Flux ACT is to promote the election of endorsed
candidates to the Legislative Assembly of the ACT. Promotion and
endorsement of candidates will be contextually appropriate.

Further objectives:

-  To provide every ACT voter with real democratic potential
-  To use elected candidates as a gateway for members to directly
   influence the Legislative Assembly within Australian law, using an
   internal voting system
-  To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents
   to participate productively without winning a seat
-  To facilitate a culture of criticism through empowering specialists
   and passionate voters
-  To stimulate the creation of new policy options

Flux ACT also adopts objectives of the federal Flux party where
possible.

Membership Criteria
-------------------

Flux ACT’s membership criterion is:

-  Maintain a list of at least 100 members who are electors within the
   ACT

Membership
~~~~~~~~~~

All ACT electors are eligible for membership. They may join by joining
the federal Flux party, and all members joining are admitted
automatically. Members of the federal Flux party may opt out of
inclusion in the state party via their membership details page. There is
no cost for membership. Each member is required to provide their name
and address such that it matches the electoral roll. Other required
details include methods of contact, an email address is required, a
phone number is optional. Their membership application is to be
submitted through Flux’s website, at https://voteflux.org. Members may
resign or revoke their membership through the resignation feature on the
member’s membership details page. There is only one category of
membership, and members are always referred to as ‘members’.

Members retain membership by retaining membership to the federal Flux
party.

There are no obligations outside of maintaining membership.

Elected candidates who are members of Flux ACT are not permitted to be
members of other ACT political parties. In a case where an elected
candidate does find themselves a member of another party, they must
immediately resign from that other party.

Members may be expelled from the party only in the case it is agreed
upon unanimously by the Leadership. Members may be suspended from the
party only in the case it is agreed upon unanimously by the Leadership.

but form a close team to assist the Leader in managing and leading the
party.

The Leader
^^^^^^^^^^

The conditions and rules surrounding the position of Leader are
identical to that of the federal Flux party, as noted in their
constitution in the section titled “The Leader”. An update to this
position in the federal constitution is enacted in this party also. The
initial term of the Leader is equal to the remaining time for the Leader
in the federal party.

titled “Deputy Leader”.

The Deputy Leader of Flux ACT is identical at all times to the Deputy
Leader of the federal Flux party.

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decision Making
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section is identical in an ongoing basis to the section titled
“Decision Making” in the federal Flux constitution.

At the time of writing this was:

    Decisions are made by the party Leader. In their absence the
    Leadership may make decisions when at least 66% in agreement.

    For the purposes of decision making a quorum is achieved when:

    -  The Leader is present
    -  The Deputy Leader and one other member of the Leadership is
       present
    -  Three members of the Leadership are present

    The Leader may imbue any member with special authority for specific
    purposes, in which case decisions made by the delegate are treated
    as though they were made by the Leader.

Annual General Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The party is required to announce an Annual General Meeting (AGM) once
per calendar year and hold the AGM within one month of the announcment
at a time of the Leadership’s choosing. These AGMs may be chaired by the
secretary of the federal Flux party or the secretary of Flux ACT.

This rules around AGMs (except those above) are identical in an ongoing
basis to the section titled “Annual General Meeting” in the federal Flux
constitution.

At the time of writing this was:

    An AGM is to be chaired by the secretary and follow an agenda. The
    agenda is open for any member to add an item. Members will be
    notified by email at least 1 week before the AGM. The Leadership is
    required to be present where possible, and the meeting will be
    livestreamed to members. Members may request to be invited to the
    AGM. Only members who are invited by the Leadership may participate.
    The AGM does not have to occur in one physical place; an online AGM
    is okay.

Party Meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Party meetings may be called by the Leadership as per the section on
decision making. A quorum is required. Members are not required to be
notified. Party meetings are not *required* to be held, ever.

Handling of Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handling of assets is the responsibility of the Leadership and they must
always act within the interests of the party. At their discretion other
party members may handle assets. The Leader and Deputy Leader are
entitled to handle assets.

Keeping of the party’s accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Leadership are responsible for managing the party’s finances. A
quorum can authorize spending of funds. Funds should be used only for
the purposes of furthering the objectives of the party, and there is no
other restriction on what funds may be spent on (except anything
prohibited under Australian Law). The Leadership and registered officer,
together, are responsible for collating and submitting required
documents to the AEC, and for keeping relevant party records for the
times required by law.

Auditing and Reporting
''''''''''''''''''''''

The auditing and reporting requirements for the above accounts are as
follows:

-  Audits and reports are to be produced on a yearly basis (beginning
   and ending with the tax year) and to be conducted and made available
   to members no later than 4 months following the close of the tax
   year.

Amendments to this Constitution
-------------------------------

Amendments to this constitution can be made with the support of at least
66% of a quorum, or at the discretion of the party Leader. They are to
be submitted via pull request to the relevant Github repository.

Endorsed Candidates
-------------------

Endorsed candidates are chosen by the Leader or by a quorum, though any
candidates chosen by a quorum are able to be vetoed by the Leader.

Internal Voting System
----------------------

Flux ACT will use an internal voting system to

-  Facilitate members participating in the democratic process
-  Facilitate minor parties and independents’ productive participation
   without winning a seat

The parameters and design choices of the system are left to the Leader,
and not within the scope of this document. There is no requirement that
the voting system for members is the same as the voting system for minor
parties. This voting system may be provided by the federal Flux party’s
voting system, though in this case participation for ACT specific issues
is restricted to ACT electors.
