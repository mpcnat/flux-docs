refuses to permit examination of any article in the person's
possession; 

is in possession of any:

#. device with the ability to record or broadcast proceedings at the
   meeting; 
#. placard or banner or other article which the Chair considers to be
   dangerous, offensive or liable to cause disruption; or

disrupts the meeting in any way.

The Chair is responsible for the orderly and timely conduct of each
General Meeting. 

The Chair must give Members attending a General Meeting a reasonable
opportunity to make comments and ask questions (including to the auditor
(if any)).

The Chair may impose a time limit on those Members wanting to make
comments and ask questions at a General Meeting. 

**Adjournment of General Meetings**

#. If a quorum is present at a General Meeting, the General Meeting must
   be adjourned if a majority of Members present direct the Chair to
   adjourn it. 
#. Only unfinished business may be dealt with at a meeting resumed after
   such an adjournment. 

**Voting at General Meetings**

Without limitation to the rights to appoint a proxy under clause 35 and
subject to clause 32.2, each Member has one vote at a General Meeting
both in a vote by poll or by show of hands.

If a membership is held jointly, only the vote of the Member who appears
first on the register of Members counts.

The Chair of the General Meeting is the only person able to challenge a
person’s right to vote at a General Meeting. The Chair must decide
whether or not the person may vote. The Chair’s decision is final. 

Voting must be conducted and decided by: 

#. a show of hands;
#. a vote in writing; or
#. another method chosen by the Chair that is fair and reasonable in the
   circumstances.

Subject to the rights of members to demand a poll as set out in the Act,
the Chair will determine the type of voting.

Before a vote is taken, the Chair must state whether any proxy votes
have been received and, if so, how the proxy votes will be cast.

On a show of hands, the Chair’s decision is conclusive evidence of the
result of the vote. 

The Chair and the meeting minutes do not need to state the number or
proportion of the votes recorded in favour or against a resolution. 

**Resolutions and Statements of Members**

This clause does not limit any other right that a Member has to propose
a resolution at a General Meeting.

Members with at least 5% of the votes that may be cast on a resolution,
or collectively together 100
`Members <http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s9.html#member>`__
who are entitled to vote at a General Meeting, may give:

#. written notice to the Company of a resolution they propose to move at
   a General Meeting (**Members’ Resolution**); and/or
#. a written request to the Company that the Company give all of its
   Members a statement about a proposed resolution or any other matter
   that may properly be considered at a General Meeting (**Members’
   Statement**).

The percentage of votes that Members have is to be worked out as at
midnight on the day immediately preceding the date before the Members’
notice is given or its request is made. 

A notice of a Members’ Resolution must set out the wording of the
proposed resolution and be signed by the Members proposing the
resolution.

A request to distribute a Members’ Statement must set out the statement
to be distributed and be signed by the Members making the request.

Separate copies of a document setting out the notice or request may be
signed by Members if the wording is the same in each copy.

If the Company has been given notice of a Members' Resolution under
clause 33.2(a), the resolution must be considered at the next General
Meeting which occurs more than 2 months after the notice is given.

If the Company has been given a notice or request under clause 33.2:

#. in time to send the notice of proposed Members’ Resolution or a copy
   of the Members' Statement to Members with a notice of meeting, it
   must do so at the Company’s cost; or
#. too late to send the notice of proposed Members’ Resolution or a copy
   of the Members' Statement to Members with a notice of meeting, then
   the Members who proposed the resolution or made the request must pay
   the expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in giving Members
   notice of the proposed Members’ Resolution or a copy of the Members'
   Statement. However, at a General Meeting, the Members may pass a
   resolution that the Company will pay these expenses.

The Company does not need to send the notice of proposed Members’
Resolution or a copy of the Members' Statement to Members if: 

#. it is more than 1,000 words long;
#. the Directors consider it may be defamatory;
#. clause 33.7(b) applies, and the Members who proposed the resolution
   or made the request have not paid the Company enough money to cover
   the cost of sending the notice of the proposed Members’ Resolution or
   a copy of the Members' Statement to Members; or
#. in the case of a proposed Members’ Resolution, the resolution does
   not relate to a matter that may be properly considered at a General
   Meeting or is otherwise not a valid resolution able to be put to the
   Members. 

#. **Circular Resolutions of Members**

Subject to the Act, the Directors may put a resolution to the Members to
pass a resolution without a General Meeting being held (a **Members**
**Circular Resolution**).

A Members Circular Resolution is passed if all the Members entitled to
vote on the resolution sign or agree to the Members Circular Resolution,
in the manner set out in clauses 34.3 or 34.4.

Members may sign:

#. a single document setting out the Members Circular Resolution and
   containing a statement that they agree to the resolution; or
#. separate copies of that document, as long as the wording is the same
   in each copy. 

The Company may send a Members Circular Resolution by email to Members
and Members may agree by sending a reply email to that effect, including
the text of the resolution in their reply.

**Appointment of Proxy**

A Member (**Relevant Member**) may appoint a proxy to attend and vote at
a General Meeting on their behalf.

A proxy does not need to be a Member.

A proxy appointed to attend and vote for a Relevant Member has the same
rights as the Relevant Member to:

#. speak at the meeting;
#. vote in a vote in writing (but only to the extent allowed by the
   appointment); and
#. join in to demand a vote in writing under clause 35.3(b).

An appointment of proxy (proxy form) must be signed by the Relevant
Member appointing the proxy and must contain:

#. the Relevant Member’s name and address;
#. the Company’s name;
#. the proxy’s name or the name of the office held by the proxy; and
#. the meeting(s) at which the appointment may be used.

A proxy appointment may be standing (ongoing).

Proxy forms must be received by the Company at the Company’s registered
address at least 48 hours before a meeting. 

A proxy does not have the authority to speak and vote for a Relevant
Member at a meeting while the Member is at the meeting.

Unless the Company receives written notice before the start or
resumption of a General Meeting at which a proxy votes, a vote cast by
the proxy is valid even if, before the proxy votes, the Relevant Member
making the appointment:

#. dies;
#. is mentally incapacitated; 
#. revokes the proxy’s appointment; or
#. revokes the authority of a representative or agent who appointed the
   proxy.

A proxy appointment may specify the way the proxy must vote on a
particular resolution. 

A proxy is not entitled to vote on a show of hands (but this does not
prevent a Member appointed as a proxy from voting as a Member on a show
of hands).

When a vote in writing is held, a proxy:

#. does not need to vote, unless the proxy appointment specifies the way
   they must vote;
#. if the way they must vote is specified on the proxy form, must vote
   that way; and
#. if the proxy is also a Member or holds more than one proxy, may cast
   the votes held in different ways.

#. **Minutes and Records**

The Company must, within one month, make and keep the following records:

#. minutes of proceedings and resolutions of General Meetings;
#. minutes of Members Circular Resolutions;
#. a copy of a notice of each General Meeting; and
#. a copy of a Members’ statement distributed to Members under clause
   32.

The Company must, within one month, make and keep the following records:

#. minutes of proceedings and resolutions of each meeting of Directors
   (including meetings of any Committees); and
#. minutes of resolutions contained in Circular Resolutions of
   Directors.

To allow Members to inspect the Company’s records: 

#. the Company must give a Member access to the records set out in
   clause 36.1; and
#. the Directors may authorise a Member to inspect other records of the
   Company, including records referred to in clause 36.2. 

The Directors must ensure that minutes of a General Meeting or a
Directors’ meeting are signed within a reasonable time after the meeting
by:

#. the Chair of the meeting; or
#. the Chair of the next meeting.

#. **Financial and Related Records**

The Company must make and keep written records that:

#. correctly record and explain its transactions and financial position
   and operations; and 
#. enable true and fair financial statements to be prepared and/or to be
   audited.

The Company must retain its records for at least seven years.

The Directors must take reasonable steps to ensure that the Company's
records are kept safe.

**Confidentiality and Publicity**

Subject to clause 38.5, a Member must not disclose any Confidential
Information.

A Member must not use Confidential Information in any manner which may
cause or be calculated to cause loss to the Company or the other
Members.

A Member must not make any public announcement or issue any press
release regarding the Company.  All public announcements and press
releases will be issued by the Board and will represent the position of
the Company not individual Members.

Each Member must use its best endeavours to ensure that none of its
proxies, officers, employees or agents:

#. subject to clause 38.5, disclose any Confidential Information;
#. use any Confidential Information in any manner which may cause or be
   calculated to cause loss to the Company or the other Members; or
#. make any public announcement or issue any press release regarding the
   Company.

A Member may disclose Confidential Information:

#. with the prior written consent of all the Board;
#. if it is required to do so by law or by any recognised stock exchange
   on which its shares are listed;
#. if the Confidential Information has come within the public domain,
   other than by a breach of this clause 38 by any party;
#. to the party’s professional advisers (provided such professional
   adviser owes a duty to the party to maintain the confidentiality of
   the Confidential Information); and 
#. if it is required to do so by a Governmental Agency,

but in the case of public announcements and press releases only, to the
extent possible, it must consult with the Board before making the
disclosure and use reasonable endeavours to follow the form and content
of the disclosure proposed by the Board.

#. **Amendment**

As set out in the Act, the Members may, by Special Resolution:

#. modify any one or more of the provisions of this Constitution; and
#. repeal or repeal and replace this Constitution in its entirety.

**Notices**

A notice or other communication connected with this document
(**Notice**) must be in writing and in English.

A Notice must be:

#. delivered to the recipient’s address or registered office;
#. posted to the recipient’s address or registered office by prepaid
   ordinary post (or airmail, if posted to or from a place outside
   Australia); or

as notified in writing from time to time. 

Service of a Notice is deemed to have occurred, if sent:

#. as a delivered letter – at the time it is delivered;
#. as a posted letter – on the fifth Business Day after posting (or the
   tenth, if posted to or from a place outside Australia);
