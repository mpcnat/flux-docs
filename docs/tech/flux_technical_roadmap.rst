Flux Technical Roadmap
======================

This respository is for:

-  Discussion of Flux tech docs and plans
-  A place for people to openly criticise and contribute to the Flux
   roadmap and its implementation
-  A place to discuss the direction, intention, and implementation of
   the roadmap


Contribution and Guidelines
---------------------------

To contribute the easiest way is through the GitHub interface. You can
create and edit documents, comment on issues, etc. You should submit a
**pull request** to have something added or changed. *(When you do this
a copy of this repository will be made on your account with your
changes. A **pull request** is a request to ‘pull’ your changes into the
main repository.)*

-  All questions/discussion should be initiated `by creating a new issue`_
-  The purpose of this repository is as stated above - please keep this
   in mind when participating
-  Use tags where possible to identify questions into some of the common
   categories
-  Meta conversation is allowed (e.g. discussion of these guidelines)
-  Quote the important bit of what you’re replying to unless they’re
   within a few posts above you
-  Mention people when you reply to them (using @username, e.g.
   @XertroV)
-  Use Markdown for writing documents/comments - `guide - seems good`_,
   `cheatsheet`_,

Near Term Roadmap
-----------------

-  [ ] - Figure out community discussion forums - `#1`_

   -  `some discussion on problems with discourse and possible solutions`_
   -  tl;dr - `self hosted discourse`_ is not working out so well, one
      idea is to use a thin layer over github issues (free, enduring,
      easy-ish)

-  [ ] - Add `Contributing.md`_ - `#4`_

   -  Sources of ideas: `Fallible Ideas`_ - not 100% applicable but good
      foundation, `ThoughtBot code of conduct`_ - note: would prefer to
      just allow discussion of conduct w/o going to authority-based
      extremes; simple and non-authoritarian is good

-  [ ] - Build community into repository control

   -  [ ] - Build a small team of 5 core maintainers. Progress: 1/5

-  [ ] - Add and maintain `TechJournal.md`_
-  [ ] - Lay out ideas for the website + membership backend
-  [ ] - Lay out ideas for longer term blockchain solution + oracles
-  [ ] - Document current tech stack + setup - `#2`_
-  [ ] - Open source membership backend - `#3`_
-  [ ] - Rebuild membership interface (ideally
